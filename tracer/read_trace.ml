(* why is this so messy? because tls-0.1.0 (which we used to produce traces) uses
   different data types! Also, the trace is only partial (esp cipher_state is not
   marshalled to disk). In here, we only read those traces (and make them complete!). *)

(* we currently focus on traces recorded by the server, thus some partial pattern matches
   (don't expect this to work for a client trace) *)

(* since record-out is emitted after state-out, we install encryptor before record-out ccs *)

(* since cipher_st is only partially marshaled, we treat it carefully (and recompute the ctx
   for AwaitClientChangeCipherSpec), installing them on change-cipher-spec-out *)

(* we also preserve session_data from the current handshake when we
   sent out Finished (handshake-out Finished below), data structure
   (of 0.3) has a session list in the handshake_state record *)
